### Week 6 Assignment
This week was all about setting up multiple web pages linked together,
 one page with a locally hosted video file, and others with iframes.

### What I learned and Issues I Faced
I learned a lot more about CSS as I incorporated that on my pages to help with layout.
I thought about including a separate styles.css file
but at least for this one assignment I decided to just stick with using style tags in the
header of each page since I only had a few pages to worry about.
Next time though I will utilize a single styles.css text file for convenience purposes. 

I also re-learned how to work with the iframe tag, as well as built-in video tag.


### Conclusion
It was fun working with incorporating the various images and videos that I found
with this mock up website assignment.  I look forward to moving along in more
web development adventures!
