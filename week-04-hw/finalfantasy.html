  <p> <dfn>Final Fantasy</dfn> is a video game franchise developed and published by Square Enix, formerly known as Squaresoft before
    the merger with Enix.</p>
  <p>The majority of the games are stand-alone single player stories with unique characters, scenarious, and settings.
    However there have been several spin-offs and sequeles to the main series games that continue the stories within the same
    worlds.  The series is defined by its recurring gameplay mechanics, themes and features. Commonly recurring features include the series' "mascot" creature, chocobos,
    that are often used as steeds; a character named Cid who is usually associated with engineering; moogles, cute flying creatures that often aid the player by facilitating some of the game mechanics;
    the mythology-based summoned creatures that can be called forth to aid players in battle and also commonly battled as bosses; the job system where playable characters are defined by their job class;
    and the active time battle system, an evolution of the classic turn-based system common for JRPGs where the units' speed determines how many actions they can take.

  <p> My personal favorite game from the <cite>Final Fantasy</cite> series is <abbr title="Final Fantasy VII">FFVII</abbr>. <br>
  Although, some fans of the franchise would consider that one to be the most <s> amazing</s> OVERRATED title from the series</p>
