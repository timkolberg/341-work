### Week 4 Assignment
This week was all about working with various HTML semantic markup tags.
I learned a lot of new tags, as I implemented the various ones on my recipe web page.

### What I learned and Issues I Faced
I've worked on pages with nested lists in them before, but had never actually created one from scratch, so that was fun.
Getting the unordered list centered was a little tricky, but I ended up using css to tell the ul just what to do.
A quick google search helped me find `  ul {
    display:table;
    margin:0 auto;
     }` this css which I implemented on my recipe home page via a css style tag.

### Wayback Machine Observations
The first website I looked into was the Bethesda Softworks website domain.  Their original domain was bethsoft.com so I looked that up via the wayback machine
website.  What I first noticed about their original website was the simplicity of its layout.  It didn't have very many graphics, or navigation to that many other pages.
Also, their original website design didn't really show a whole lot of in depth artistic style to it, considering Bethesda is a game development company (the same one that made the Elder Scrolls series).  From what I gather when the original World Wide Web came out, it was much harder to design in depth style and layout to a website than it is today.  After viewing Bethesda's newer website snapshots I can easily confirm that it is much easier to design more artistic styles to your website, and there are much more tools and features available to really customize the look and feel of your website.

The other website I observed was a web page for a video game studio founded by one of the original creators of Final Fantasy, Hironobu Sakaguchi.
The studio name is Mistwalker, and their first website snapshots (originating from around 2008) wer very simple and basic with its layout.  However there also seemed to be a clearly thought out design to the layout, as the white space seemed to be balanced enough with the graphics and images that were displayed to make the overal experience welcoming to the viewer.  As the web site progressed throughout the years, it became more flooded with content, and seemed to mold itself into a more conservative corporate-like structure.  It became easier to navigate, but not as exciting to me as the original design when the company was first founded.

### Conclusion
Overall, this week was a great experience for me with HTML semantic markup tags, and again I look forward to continuing along the web development path!
I was unable to provide any screenshots of my recipe web page development progress, as by the time I read about that request within the assignment I had already finsiehd
my pages, so there are no images to provide.
