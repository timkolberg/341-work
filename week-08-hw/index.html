All about waffle invaders -->

The Waffles have landed! <br />
Watch out world, extraterrestrial waffles have landed on our planet
from a faraway galaxy, and they aren't just the kind of waffle that
we're used to.  These waffles are alive, and power hungry.
<br />
Oh yeah, and they taste terrible too! <br />
Not only that, these waffles are military trained, and have fought
off the Air Force, Army, Navy, and soon to be Marines! <br />
All people are advised to stay indoors, and if you see any waffles
nearby call this number: 1-800-PANCAKES.
