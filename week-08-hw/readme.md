### Week 8 Assignment
This week was all about CSS!

### What I learned and Issues I Faced
I had forgotten how to import google fonts to be
used with CSS, so that was great review.
I had fun going through color pickers to find a desired color scheme for my article page.  I think I spent more time working on that than anything else.


### Conclusion
It's always fun working with CSS, as it makes designing the layout for a website much simpler and user friendly.
