## MART 341 Week 03 Assignment
## Readme Markdown Document


This week was all about an introduction to HTML elements.  I fortunately have worked with
HTML before, so most of this week was review for me.  I have worked with various HTML tags before, and this week was welcoming for me to work with familiar tags such as header and paragraph tags.

However, I had not used the emphasized text tag before.
A quick google search [Thank you W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_em.asp)
revealed the details of this tag, and that it basicallly has a web browser display
the text in italics.

The only slight issue I ran into was when I created the original index.html file.  I first created the file using a Windows Explorer GUI window, then I used PowerShell to navigate and open the file.  I had, however accidentally created a new file using PowerShell instead of opening the already existing one, because when I executed the command `atom /.index.html` instead of `atom ./index.html` it made a new .index file.  After discovering this error I simply deleted the original `index.html` file and renamed the `.index.html` file by removing its preceding `.` character.

Overall, this week was a great review of HTML for me, and I look forward to continuing along the web development path!
