      <h1><em>The Road Not Taken </em></h1>
      <h2><em> by Robert Frost </em></h2>
      <p>Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,<br />
      And sorry I could not travel both<br />
      And be one traveler, long I stood<br />
      And looked down one as far as I could<br />
      To where it bent in the undergrowth;</p>

      <p>Then took the other, as just as fair,<br />
      And having perhaps the better claim,<br />
      Because it was grassy and wanted wear;<br />
      Though as for that the passing there<br />
      Had worn them really about the same,</p>

      <p>And both that morning equally lay<br />
      In leaves no step had trodden black.<br />
      Oh, I kept the first for another day!<br />
      Yet knowing how way leads on to way,<br />
      I doubted if I should ever come back.</p>

      <p>I shall be telling this with a sigh<br />
      Somewhere ages and ages hence:<br />
      Two roads diverged in a wood, and I&mdash;<br />
      I took the one less traveled by,<br />
      And that has made all the difference.<br />
