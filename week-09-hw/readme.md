### Week 9 Assignment
This week was all about continued CSS studies

### What I learned and Issues I Faced
I have worked with layout, border, margins etc. etc.
using CSS before, but it never hurts to practice and learn more
about how it works and how
to use it structure your web design layout effectively.

### Color Pallete
Since I chose my web page subject matter to be the 
MATRIX, I decided to go with a mostly black color
scheme, with some white, and of course raining
green code background image!




### Conclusion
While CSS seems like such a simple language
to implement it holds so many possibilities with
regards to configuring and constructing web page
layout, rules, structure etc. etc. when designing and
developing web pages.  One could never fully be satisfied
with their knowledge of and experience with utlizing
this language in the web dev world.
